# AssignmentParser

## Introduction

AssignmentParser is a program that takes in a list and automates the process of adding them as a task in a [Todoist](https://todoist.com) account.

Built with [Python](https://python.org), [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org), and the [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com) this program was made to address a minor inconvenience I had. To understand the context that led to the creation of this project, take a look at [CONTEXT.md](https://github.com/arashnrim/AssignmentParser/blob/main/CONTEXT.md).
